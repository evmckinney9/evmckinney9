```
- Message me about science, programming, grad school, philosophy, comic books, anything you like 💬
#### I love learning about Quantum Computing and things Machine-Learning, Scientific Programming 📖
  -  Quantum Transpilation, Efficient Quantum Instruction Sets
  -  Gate Decomposition Theory, Weyl Chambers (?!)
  -  Superconducting QC Architecture 
 
 #### I’m currently in my second year of grad school at Pitt
  - Quantum computing hardware-software co-design with Dr. Alex K. Jones and Dr. Michael Hatridge
  - SNAIL qubit coupling topologies for increased quantum circuit parllelization, reduced data movement overheads
  - Optimized Hamiltonians using operational speedlimits and expected gate decomposition costs

#### Previously, I've been at
  - Los Alamos National Laboratory
  - Ames National Laboratory
  - Iowa State University

### Fun Code
If my code looks bad it's because I'm trying to learn new things :)
