### Research Code
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Quantum Computing Hardware-Software Co-Design

We research the design of quantum computers for efficient and reliable operation. Our main contributions are the design of qubit coupling topologies which allow for a reduction in data movement and an optimized selection of quantum instruction sets based on hardware speed limitations. Our designs utilize Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement (SNAIL) modulators to enable high-degree couplings between qubits which support parallelized quantum circuit execution. We proposed a quantum 4-ary Tree and a hypercube inspired “Corral” built from interconnected quantum modules, which reduce data movement overheads against the latest commercial quantum computers. Furthermore, the SNAIL natively implements a powerful family of gates realized through photon exchange operations; however, there is a practical speed limit which arises from the couplers' tolerance for strong driving when one or more pumps is applied. We proposed a method for selecting the best ratio of drive, considering both the theoretical computing power and practical speed limits for candidate basis gates naturally realized by a quantum system. Additionally, our proposed parallel drive technique drives the modulator and qubits simultaneously, enabling a richer capability of a two-qubit basis gate and potentially absorbing the single-qubit drive times. This research has the potential to improve the performance and reliability of quantum computers, especially for scaling devices past the NISQ-era.
