### Research Code
- 📖 I'm currently learning about Quantum Compilation, Efficient Quantum Instruction Sets, Quantum Resource Theory
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Quantum Computing Hardware-Software Co-Design

We research the design of quantum computers for efficient and reliable operation. Our main contributions are the design of qubit coupling topologies which allow for a reduction in data movement and an optimized selection of quantum instruction sets based on hardware speed limitations. Our designs utilize Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement (SNAIL) modulators to enable high-degree couplings between qubits which support parallelized quantum circuit execution. This research has the potential to improve the performance and reliability of quantum computers, especially for scaling devices past the NISQ-era.
